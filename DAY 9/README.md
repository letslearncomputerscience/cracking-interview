## DAY 9. Bit Manipulation

List of tasks:

- [Insertion](https://github.com/yankouskia/cracking-interview/tree/master/DAY%209/Insertion.java)  
  *You are given two 32-bit numbers, N and M, and two bit positions, i and j. Write a method to insert M into N such that H starts at bit j and ends at bit i.You can assume that the bits] through i have enough space to fit all of M. That is, if M = 10011, you can assume that there are at least 5 bits between j and i. You would not, for example, have j = 3 and i = 2, because M could not fully fit between bit 3 and bit 2.*  

- [Binary to String](https://github.com/yankouskia/cracking-interview/tree/master/DAY%209/BinaryToString.java)  
  *Given a real number between 0 and 1 (e.g., 0.72) that is passed in as a double, print the binary representation. If the number cannot be represented accurately in binary with at most 32 characters, print "ERROR."*  

- [Flip Bit  to Win](https://github.com/yankouskia/cracking-interview/tree/master/DAY%209/FlipBitToWin.java)  
  *You have an integer and you can flip exactly one bit from a 0 to a 1. Write code to find the length of the longest sequence of 1 s you could create.  
  __EXAMPLE:__  
  Input: 1775 (or : 11011101111)  
  Output: 8*
